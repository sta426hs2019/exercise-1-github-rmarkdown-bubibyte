## _Oreochromis tanganicae_

That is my favourite fish. It is a tilapia species which is endemic to Lake Tanganyika. In swahili it is known as *"ngege"*.   
The species belongs to the _Oreochromis_ genus which is the second most farmed fish family in the world (just behind carps).

We just started a pilot project to farm these beautiful fish to foster food security and provide an income stream to farmers and entrepreneurs in the Lake Tanganyika Region.

"We" is our company BongoFISH headquartered in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. If you are interested in what we do, follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BongoFishTanzania/).
